Unity AI Dodgeball project implementing a finite state machine and throw-decision logic for autonomous agents.

# AI Dodgeball — Finite State Machine Project

**Autonomous dodgeball agents built with finite state machines and decision-based targeting logic in Unity.**

This project demonstrates fundamental game AI concepts, including state-based behavior, navigation, and throw decision logic for autonomous agents in a dodgeball simulation.

## Overview

In this project, each agent (minion) uses a **finite state machine (FSM)** to decide what to do at any moment:
- **Collect balls**
- **Navigate the play area**
- **Choose safe and effective throws**
- **React to teammates and opponents**

The AI uses decision logic to balance aggression and safety, avoid obstacles, and select targets intelligently.
